# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Space Exploration Learning Game is an interactive 3D educational experience that allows users to explore our solar system and learn about celestial bodies through immersive gameplay. Built with Astro for server-side rendering and Three.js for 3D visualization, the game combines entertainment with education by providing detailed information about planets and stars, enhanced by AI-powered chatbot interactions for deeper learning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to access a main menu with navigation options, so that I can start the game or adjust settings before playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a main menu with "Start Game" and "Settings" options
2. WHEN the user clicks "Start Game" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the solar system view
3. WHEN the user clicks "Settings" THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for the game experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view a 3D representation of our solar system with the Sun and 8 major planets, so that I can visually explore the celestial bodies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL render a 3D solar system with the Sun at the center
2. WHEN the solar system loads THEN the system SHALL display all 8 major planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) in their relative positions
3. WHEN rendering celestial bodies THEN the system SHALL use accurate relative sizes and orbital distances where practical for gameplay
4. WHEN the 3D scene loads THEN the system SHALL provide smooth rendering at acceptable frame rates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate to specific planets or the Sun and see detailed information, so that I can learn about different celestial bodies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a planet or the Sun THEN the system SHALL display a popup with basic information about that celestial body
2. WHEN the information popup appears THEN the system SHALL include key facts such as size, distance from Sun, composition, and interesting characteristics
3. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL present content in an engaging, educational format suitable for learning
4. WHEN the user wants to close the popup THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to dismiss the information panel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a curious learner, I want to ask detailed questions about celestial bodies through an AI chatbot, so that I can get deeper insights beyond the basic information provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the AI chatbot interface THEN the system SHALL provide a conversational interface for asking questions
2. WHEN the user asks questions about celestial bodies THEN the system SHALL provide accurate, educational responses through AI integration
3. WHEN using the chatbot THEN the system SHALL maintain context about the current celestial body being explored
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL provide information appropriate for educational purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to zoom in and out of the solar system view, so that I can examine details closely or see the broader perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uses zoom controls THEN the system SHALL smoothly adjust the camera distance from the solar system
2. WHEN zooming in THEN the system SHALL maintain visual quality and allow detailed examination of celestial bodies
3. WHEN zooming out THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive view of the entire solar system
4. WHEN zooming THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls (mouse wheel, touch gestures, or UI buttons)
5. WHEN at any zoom level THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth navigation and interaction capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a future user, I want the system to be designed for potential expansion to other planetary systems, so that my learning experience can grow beyond our solar system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system architecture THEN the system SHALL use modular components that can accommodate multiple planetary systems
2. WHEN structuring data models THEN the system SHALL support extensible celestial body definitions beyond our solar system
3. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL design interfaces that can scale to multiple star systems
4. WHEN building the 3D rendering system THEN the system SHALL architect components to handle various stellar configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and perform well, so that I can have a smooth gaming and learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL utilize Astro's SSR capabilities for fast initial page loads
2. WHEN rendering 3D content THEN the system SHALL optimize Three.js performance for smooth frame rates
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL leverage Vercel's deployment optimizations for global performance
4. WHEN using UI components THEN the system SHALL implement Shadcn components for consistent, performant interface elements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface, so that I can focus on learning rather than struggling with navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any interface element THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for user interactions
2. WHEN navigating the 3D space THEN the system SHALL offer intuitive controls that feel natural to users
3. WHEN switching between different views THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and clear navigation paths
